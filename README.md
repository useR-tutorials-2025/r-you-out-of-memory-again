**Overview**

*Description:* Struggling with datasets that crash R or take forever to process? This hands-on workshop will transform how you handle large data in R! We'll work with a real 9GB dataset (40+ million rows) to learn modern big data tools that scale from your laptop to production systems. You'll master Arrow for lightning-fast file operations, DuckDB for powerful analytics, and discover when to use each tool for maximum efficiency. By the end, you'll confidently process datasets much larger than what traditional R can handle using familiar dplyr syntax.

***Learning goals:***

1.  Understand and practice the "view don't load" mindset using Arrow's lazy evaluation to process data larger than memory.

2.  Apply the 6 core dplyr verbs (`filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`) and learn strategic `collect()` placement for optimal performance

3.  Practice converting between file formats (CSV ‚Üî Parquet) and see dramatic speed improvements in action.

4.  Build and execute multi-step analytical pipelines using familiar dplyr syntax that scales to datasets with millions of rows.

5.  Experience DuckDB for complex analytics including joins and window functions on large datasets.

6.  Learn when to choose Arrow vs. DuckDB vs. traditional R for different analytical tasks and data sizes.

    *Target audience:* R users comfortable with basic dplyr operations (`filter()`, `select()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`) who want to scale their analyses to larger datasets. No prior experience with Arrow or DuckDB required.

**Pre-work**

1.  Please have a recent version of R and RStudio installed.

```         
-    R ‚â• 4.2

-    RStudio ‚â• 2024.04.1+748
```

2.  Install the following packages

```{{r}}
install.packages(c("usethis", "tidyverse", "arrow", "duckdb", "DBI", "dbplyr", "curl", "glue"))
```

3.  **Critical:** Follow the detailed setup instructions in the provided `pre-workshop_data_download_file.qmd` document to create your project folder and download the 9GB Seattle Library dataset (this takes 8-15 minutes). This step-by-step guide will ensure your workspace is properly configured for the workshop. Github will not allow for this data size as .csv

4.  System requirements: At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended) and 15GB free disk space for dataset and converted files.
